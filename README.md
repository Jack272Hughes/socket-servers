# HTTP Servers and Sockets
To help me practise Java, I was given the objective to create an HTTP server. I decided to go one step further and created this server using the built in HTTPServer as well as creating my own version using Java's ServerSockets.

As an added bonus I have also dabbled in setting up a server that can accept and open websocket connections although messaging across an established connection is not correctly in place as the server doesn't listen for messages from already established connections.
